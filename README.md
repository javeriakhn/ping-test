Helm Chart for Ping App
Welcome to the Helm chart for Ping App! This Helm chart simplifies the deployment of Ping App on Kubernetes.

Overview
This Helm chart provides a templated configuration to deploy Ping App on a Kubernetes cluster. It allows you to manage the deployment with customizable values and parameters, facilitating a flexible and reproducible deployment process.

Prerequisites

Quick Start
1. Add the Helm Repository
If you are using a public Helm repository, add it using:

Copy code
git clone [repository-url]
cd [repository-name]
2. Install the Chart
Install the chart with the following command:

Replace [release-name] with a name you choose for this deployment and ./path-to-chart with the path to the Helm chart directory.

3. Customize the Chart

bash
Copy code
helm install [release-name] ./path-to-chart -f values-production.yaml
Or, for specific overrides:

bash
Copy code
helm install [release-name] ./path-to-chart --set key=value
